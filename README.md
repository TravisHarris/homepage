# Homepage

This is a space themed homepage for a desktop web browser.

Stare into nothingness everytime you fire up chrome, firefox or safari. Trust me it's actually quite refreshing.
This homepage comes with equiped with a futuristic virtual ui overlayed on the window capable of displaying:

The time in 12 or 24 hour format,
The weather in your local area with temps in celcius or farenheit,
Both, one or the other, none, just stare into nothingness seriously.

This was built to try out the CSS grid layout, it started quite ambitous, thinking I could just refresh the grid layout with different names everytime and make it completely customizable (put elements wherever you want, time in the top right corner, weather in the middle) but that quickly became way too complicated and beyond the scope of what I was looking to jump into. So I settled on a simple fixed toggle mechanism much to the akin of the momentum chrome extension (which I use personally and love).

Enjoy!!
